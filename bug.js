This bug occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that contains special characters, such as spaces or accented characters.  The image fails to load, and no error is thrown in the console.  The problem stems from how Expo handles URI encoding internally; it doesn't always correctly encode the URI before passing it to the underlying native image loading libraries. This results in the image failing to load silently.
